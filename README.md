# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Summary
This is a code refactor challenge to rework the CSS to make it more efficient. Throughout the CSS, I've gone through and reorganized the CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. You can also see the comments for why I made each decision if you want to look through the code.
